> The goal of this example is to show you how to get a Node.js application into a Docker container. The guide is intended for development, and not for a production deployment. 

## Building your image

```sh
Go to the directory that has your Dockerfile and run the following command to build the Docker image. The -t flag lets you tag your image so it's easier to find later using the docker images command:

docker build -t <your username>/node-app .

```
## Run the image

```sh
Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container. Run the image you previously built:

docker run -p 49160:1000 -d <your username>/node-web-app

```
## Test

```sh
To test your app, get the port of your app that Docker mapped:
docker run -p 49160:1000 -d <your username>/node-web-app

docker ps

```

## Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```
